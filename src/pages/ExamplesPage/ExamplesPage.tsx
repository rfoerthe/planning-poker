            User Story: As a user, I want to be able to log in to the application using my email and password.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 3 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team considers this user story to have medium complexity compared to other user stories. It
            involves implementing authentication logic, verifying credentials, and providing appropriate error handling.
            The team's collective experience and judgment led to the consensus estimation of 3 story points.

            <br />
            User Story: As a user, I want to search for products based on various filters (e.g., price, category,
            brand).
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 5 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team considers this user story to be more complex compared to simpler user stories.
            Implementing the search functionality involves handling multiple filter options, integrating with the
            database, and ensuring efficient search performance. The team estimates it to be a moderate-sized task.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>
            <br />
            User Story: As an administrator, I want to be able to generate monthly reports on user activity and sales
            performance.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 8 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team identifies this user story as a larger and more involved task. It requires designing and
            implementing reporting functionalities, gathering and aggregating data from multiple sources, and generating
            meaningful insights. The complexity and effort involved lead to a higher estimation.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>
            <br />
            User Story: As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 2 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team considers this user story relatively simple and straightforward. Implementing a password
            reset functionality typically involves providing an email verification mechanism and updating the user's
            password in the database. The team estimates it to be a smaller task compared to others.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>
            <br />
            User Story: As a user, I want to be able to add products to my shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: Medium (T-shirt size)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team uses T-shirt sizes for estimation. Adding products to a shopping cart and enabling the
            checkout process involves handling user interactions, managing cart state, updating inventory, and
            integrating with payment gateways. The team estimates it to be of medium size in terms of effort and
            complexity.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>
            <br />
            User Story: As a user, I want to be able to upload and attach files to my project tasks.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 3 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team considers this user story to be of moderate complexity. Implementing file upload
            functionality involves handling file storage, validation, and linking files to specific tasks or projects.
            The team estimates it to be a medium-sized task.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>
            <br />
            User Story: As an administrator, I want to be able to create and manage user roles and permissions.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 5 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team identifies this user story as a larger and more complex task. Implementing role-based
            access control requires designing a flexible permission system, defining roles, managing user permissions,
            and ensuring proper security measures. The effort and complexity involved lead to a higher estimation.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>
            <br />
            User Story: As a user, I want to receive email notifications for important updates and events.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 2 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team considers this user story relatively straightforward. Implementing email notifications
            involves integrating with an email service provider, setting up templates, and triggering emails based on
            specific events or triggers. The team estimates it to be a smaller task compared to others.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>
            <br />
            User Story: As a user, I want to be able to filter and sort search results based on different criteria.
            <br /> <br />
            Estimation: 3 story points (Fibonacci sequence)
            <br /> <br />
            Rationale: The team identifies this user story as a moderate-sized task. Implementing filtering and sorting
            functionality requires handling user preferences, building flexible search queries, and presenting sorted
            and filtered results. The team estimates it to be of medium complexity and effort.
            <br /> <br />
            <hr></hr>

            Remember, these estimations are based on hypothetical scenarios, and actual estimations may vary based on
            project-specific factors, team dynamics, and technology considerations. The primary aim is to establish a
            relative understanding of effort or complexity to aid in prioritization and planning.
